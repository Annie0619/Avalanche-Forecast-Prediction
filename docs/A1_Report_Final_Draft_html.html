<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>Forecast avalanche hazard (FAH) is reported on an ordered five-level scale, making the correct ordering of predictions as important as the exact class assignment. We build a modelling-ready dataset from operational observations in Scotland and cast next-day FAH as an ordinal forecasting problem. Data preparation standardises identifiers, audits and repairs missingness, applies physically sensible bounds, encodes circular variables with sine-cosine pairs, and adds seasonal day-of-year features. We split chronologically (80/20) with an embargo to avoid look-ahead.</p>
<p>For modelling, we turn each area�s history into 14-day windows of dynamic features, fuse static site attributes, and train an LSTM with a CORN ordinal head that predicts <span class="math inline">\(K - 1\)</span> exceedance probabilities. Class imbalance is handled by oversampling rare classes in minibatches and class-balanced per-threshold weights in the loss. We then tune monotone thresholds on the most recent validation fold to convert probabilities into labels.</p>
<p>Validation uses forward-chaining time folds; evaluation on a held-out test window reports Accuracy, Macro-F1, MAE, and Quadratic Weighted Kappa (QWK). Compared with three simple baselines (global majority, per-area majority, and persistence), the LSTM-CORN model improves ordinal-aware agreement (QWK) and reduces absolute error (MAE), with most mistakes within one level of the truth. Limitations include scarcity of High hazard days and potential sensitivity to the temporal split, but the approach is reproducible and operationally realistic, and it provides a clear path to calibration and extension.</p>

<section id="introduction" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Avalanche hazard is reported on an ordered five-level scale, making the correct ordering of predictions as important as the exact class assignment. According to the Conceptual Model of Avalanche Hazard (Statham et al., 2018), the hazard level is determined by combining two ordinal variables-likelihood of avalanche occurrence and destructive size-into a single danger rating. This motivates treating FAH as an ordinal rather than a nominal target.</p>
<p>This project assembles a modelling-ready dataset from Scottish observations and frames next-day Forecast Avalanche Hazard (FAH) as an ordinal forecasting problem. Data preparation (in R) standardises identifiers, audits and repairs missing values, applies physical plausibility checks, encodes circular angles as sine/cosine, and adds day-of-year seasonality. Model matrices are exported with an ordered target, and a chronological <span class="math inline">\(80/20\)</span> split prevents look-ahead.</p>
<p>Methodologically, we use a sequence model to reflect that hazard depends on recent conditions. We frame each area-day as a one-step-ahead forecast and feed the model a fixed 14-day look-back of daily predictors together with static site attributes. This mirrors the standard time-series set-up in which inputs comprise a recent window of observations plus static metadata (Lim and Zohren, 2021; Eq. 2.1). We implement the encoder with an LSTM over the 14-day window and concatenate the static features before the output layer.</p>
<p>For the ordinal output layer we adopt CORN (Conditional Ordinal Regression for Neural Networks). CORN decomposes a <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span>-class ordered target into <span class="math inline">\(K - 1\)</span> conditional exceedance tasks that estimate <span class="math inline">\(P(y &gt; k \mid y &gt; k - 1)\)</span>; the unconditional exceedance probabilities <span class="math inline">\(P(y &gt; k)\)</span> follow by the probability chain rule, which guarantees rank-consistent (non-increasing) probabilities across thresholds. Final class labels are obtained by thresholding these <span class="math inline">\(K - 1\)</span> probabilities and counting exceedances (Cao, Mirjalili and Raschka, 2020).</p>
<p>Because High levels are rare, we address class imbalance in two ways. First, we oversample minority classes within batches. Second, we apply the class-balanced loss based on the effective number of samples, which weights each class by <span class="math inline">\((1 - \beta)/(1 - \beta^{n_c})\)</span> so rare classes have more influence without fabricating data (Cui et al., 2019, Sec. 3).</p>
<p>Validation uses forward-chaining folds with a 10-day embargo to reflect operational constraints. Model performance is evaluated on a held-out test window using Accuracy, Macro-F1, MAE, and Quadratic Weighted Kappa (QWK). Three baseline models are used for comparison: global majority, per-area majority, and persistence (yesterday�s value). All code is reproducible, with deterministic seeds and cached lookups, and all preprocessing parameters are fit on the training data and then applied to the test set through a baked pipeline.</p>

<section id="data" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="data">Data</h3>
<p>We analysed a 2009-2025 archive of daily avalanche forecasts from the Scottish Avalanche Information Service across six forecasting regions. The prediction target is the forecast avalanche hazard (FAH) for the following day, encoded as an <em>ordered</em> categorical variable with levels:</p>
<p><em>Low &lt; Moderate &lt; Considerable - &lt; Considerable + &lt; High</em></p>
<p>Predictors comprise:<br>
1. <strong>Site and topography</strong> - OS grid identifier, location name, longitude, latitude, altitude, incline.<br>
2. <strong>Contemporaneous meteorology</strong> near the forecast location - summit air temperature, summit wind speed and direction, lower-level winds, cloud, and insolation.<br>
3. <strong>Snowpack observations</strong> derived from field tests - snow temperature, maximum temperature and hardness gradients, foot and ski penetration indices, crystal type, wetness, and a derived stability index.</p>
<p>To avoid information leakage for the FAH task, the observed hazard on the following day (OAH) was removed from the analysis dataset.</p>

<section id="type-standardisation-and-initial-feature-engineering" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="type-standardisation-and-initial-feature-engineering">1. Type standardisation and initial feature engineering</h4>
<p>We converted timestamps to Date and derived year, month, day-of-year (<code>doy</code>), and meteorological season (DJF/MAM/JJA/SON). Identifiers and descriptors were given sensible types (e.g., <code>Area</code> as a factor; OS grid and location as character). The hazard response was stored as an ordered factor (<code>FAH_ord</code>) using the level order defined above. These steps preserve the outcome�s ordinal structure for modelling and evaluation and add explicit seasonality features for downstream encoding.</p>
</section>
<section id="spatial-consistency-checks" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="spatial-consistency-checks">2. Spatial consistency checks</h4>
<p>We examined whether OS grids denote unique points. Longitude and latitude vary within OS grids, indicating that an OS grid represents an area rather than a single coordinate. Altitude is not constant within OS grids. Accordingly, altitude should not be imputed from the OS grid identifier alone: since each grid covers heterogeneous terrain, we instead query elevation using the precise latitude-longitude coordinates.</p>
</section>
<section id="record-keys-duplicates-and-consolidation" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="record-keys-duplicates-and-consolidation">3. Record keys, duplicates, and consolidation</h4>
<p>We treated (Date, OSgrid, Area) as the record key. For any key with multiple rows, we counted-column by column-how many distinct non-missing values appeared.</p>
<ul>
<li>If the duplicates differed only by missing values, we collapsed them to a single row, taking the first available non-missing value in each column.</li>
<li>If any column showed truly conflicting observations (more than one distinct non-missing value), we kept all rows for that key and flagged the group as conflicted.</li>
</ul>
<p>This approach preserves genuine differences, avoids inventing data, and leaves a clear audit trail wherever sources disagree.</p>
</section>
<section id="missingness-audit-and-design-of-indicators" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="missingness-audit-and-design-of-indicators">4. Missingness audit and design of indicators</h4>
<p>We first measured missingness per variable and inspected its pattern. Where the absence itself could be informative, we created explicit 0/1 “was-missing” flags (before any outlier recoding). These indicators were made for: AV.cat, Ski.pen, Crystals, Wetness, Snow.Index, and the summit weather fields (Summit.Wind.Dir, Summit.Wind.Speed, Summit.Air.Temp). Doing this early ensures the indicators reflect the data as collected and aren�t confounded by later plausibility filters.</p>
<p>Some fields (e.g., Max.Temp.Grad, Max.Hardness.Grad) are only measured when a snow pit is carried out. When no pit is done those fields are blank by design, so we did not add extra “missing” indicators; instead, we impute those numeric blanks downstream for modelling.</p>
<p><strong>Snow.Index check:</strong> Because many values are exactly zero, we tested whether Snow.Index == 0 was being used as a stand-in for “no test.” It wasn�t: rows with Snow.Index = 0 didn�t show elevated missingness in pit variables, so zeros appear to be legitimate measurements (e.g., stable conditions). We therefore kept zeros as valid values and treated only NA as missing.</p>
</section>
<section id="physically-defensible-plausibility-filters" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="physically-defensible-plausibility-filters">5. Physically defensible plausibility filters</h4>
<p>We applied conservative real-world plausibility checks and recoded any violations to <code>NA</code> so they can be handled by imputation rather than ad-hoc edits. The limits reflect basic constraints (e.g., angles in <span class="math inline">\(0{-}360^\circ\)</span>, non-negative depths) and local context.</p>
<ul>
<li>Directional variables (Aspect, Wind.Dir, Summit.Wind.Dir): values outside <span class="math inline">\([0^\circ, 360^\circ]\)</span> set to <code>NA</code>.<br>
</li>
<li>Snow temperature (<span class="math inline">\(^\circ\)</span>C): values <span class="math inline">\(&gt; 5\)</span> set to NA (snow cannot persist above <span class="math inline">\(\sim 0^\circ\)</span>C; a small buffer accommodates sensor and entry noise).<br>
</li>
<li>Insolation (index): values outside <span class="math inline">\(0{-}20\)</span> set to NA.<br>
</li>
<li>Incline (<span class="math inline">\(^\circ\)</span>): values <span class="math inline">\(&lt;0\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(&gt;90\)</span> set to NA.<br>
</li>
<li>Foot penetration (cm): values <span class="math inline">\(&lt;0\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(&gt;100\)</span> set to NA.<br>
</li>
<li>Total snow depth (cm): values <span class="math inline">\(&lt;0\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(&gt;500\)</span> set to NA (regional plausibility).<br>
</li>
<li>Maximum temperature gradient (<span class="math inline">\(^\circ\)</span>C/10 cm): values <span class="math inline">\(&gt; 10\)</span> set to NA.<br>
</li>
<li>Altitude (m): values <span class="math inline">\(&lt;0\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(&gt;1400\)</span> set to NA (Scotland�s highest peak <span class="math inline">\(\approx 1345\)</span> m).</li>
</ul>
<p>Marking impossible readings as <code>NA</code> prevents them from skewing summaries or model fits and lets the downstream multivariate imputer estimate plausible replacements from the remaining data.</p>

<section id="altitude-repair-via-coordinate-based-elevation-lookup" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="altitude-repair-via-coordinate-based-elevation-lookup">6. Altitude repair via coordinate-based elevation lookup</h4>
<p>For the small number of missing altitudes, we queried an open elevation service at rounded (<code>latitude</code>, <code>longitude</code>) and filled <code>Alt</code> where a value was returned. One queried coordinate yielded <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> m (a sea-loch), indicating a geolocation error. For that single case, we replaced the coordinate with the area mean (Creag Meagaidh) and re-queried. To ensure deterministic compilation, elevation results are cached locally; subsequent runs read from cache if the service is unavailable.</p>
</section>
<section id="circular-encodings-for-directional-variables" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="circular-encodings-for-directional-variables">7. Circular encodings for directional variables</h4>
<p><strong>Circular encodings for directional variables.</strong> Because angles wrap around at <span class="math inline">\(360^\circ\)</span>, treating them as ordinary numbers creates an artificial jump between <span class="math inline">\(359^\circ\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(0^\circ\)</span>. We therefore replaced each directional variable (<code>Wind.Dir</code>, <code>Summit.Wind.Dir</code>, <code>Aspect</code>) with two new variables that locate the direction on the unit circle: the sine and cosine of the angle (in radians). This keeps <span class="math inline">\(0^\circ\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(360^\circ\)</span> close in feature space, and removes the wrap-around discontinuity, which helps and yields smoother relationships for the models. Missing angles remained missing in both components and were imputed later.</p>
</section>
<section id="time-aware-splitting-and-leakage-control" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="time-aware-splitting-and-leakage-control">8. Time-aware splitting and leakage control</h4>
<p>The data was split chronologically into <span class="math inline">\(80\%\)</span> training and <span class="math inline">\(20\%\)</span> test by calendar time (no overlap).Any rows missing a <code>Date</code> or the target (<code>FAH_ord</code>) were dropped before the split. We checked class balance in each split; the High level is very rare and does not appear in the test window (so performance on that class cannot be evaluated). All preprocessing steps were fit on the training set only (e.g., imputation, scaling, encoding) and then applied unchanged to the test set. This setup avoids information leakage.</p>

<li><strong>Column exclusion:</strong> Dropped identifiers and free text, raw time stamps, and raw angles: <code>OSgrid</code>, <code>Location</code>, <code>Date</code>, <code>DateTime</code>, raw <code>Wind.Dir</code>, raw <code>Summit.Wind.Dir</code>, and raw <code>Aspect</code>. The raw target FAH was excluded in favour of <code>FAH_ord</code>.<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Rare-level consolidation:</strong> Collapsed very rare categorical levels to <code>"other"</code> using <span class="math inline">\(\texttt{threshold} = 0.005\)</span> to avoid sparse dummies.<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Imputation:</strong> Categorical variables were imputed by mode; numerical variables by bagged-tree imputation (bootstrap ensembles estimated on the training data), which captures non-linearities and interactions in mixed meteorological and snowpack features more effectively than mean or KNN imputation.<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Encoding:</strong> One-hot encoding of categorical predictors (including <code>Area</code>).<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Variance filtering:</strong> Removal of zero-variance and near-zero-variance predictors.<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Scaling:</strong> Standardisation of numerical predictors, excluding the 0/1 informative-missing indicators (and area dummies) to preserve their interpretability.<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Seasonality:</strong> Replacement of discrete season dummies with smooth cyclical features <span class="math inline">\(doy\_sin\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(doy\_cos\)</span> (constructed from day-of-year with leap years handled); season binaries were removed to reduce collinearity.<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Target mapping:</strong> The ordered response was mapped once to integers <span class="math inline">\(0{-}4\)</span> to provide a single source of truth for neural-network models.</li>
</ol>
<p>The recipe was prepped on the training set (estimating imputation models, encoding maps, and scaling parameters) and then baked on both training and test splits to yield model-ready matrices (<code>x_train</code>, <code>x_test</code>). For downstream modelling and plotting, a <code>Date</code> column was retained; final matrices (<span class="math inline">\(X\_{train}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(X\_{test}\)</span>) include the integer-encoded target as the last column.</p>

<section id="reproducibility-diagnostics-and-assumptions" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="reproducibility-diagnostics-and-assumptions">10. Reproducibility, diagnostics, and assumptions</h4>
<p>We fixed random seeds and kept all data-prep and modelling steps in a single scripted pipeline so that results are reproducible across runs. After baking the recipe, there were no remaining missing values in either split. We re-checked the composite key (<code>Date</code>, <code>OSgrid</code>, <code>Area</code>) after duplicate handling, and we spot-checked distributions of imputed variables to make sure they looked reasonable (plots not shown for space). Elevation queries are cached locally, so reruns do not depend on the external service.</p>
<p>Our working assumptions were:<br>
(i) the value ranges we used to flag implausible measurements reflect Scottish conditions;<br>
(ii) <code>Snow.Index == 0</code> is a <strong>valid zero</strong> (stable conditions), not a stand-in for “no test”; and<br>
(iii) the “informative-missing” indicators genuinely capture absence at the time of collection rather than artefacts created later in cleaning.</p>

<section id="limitations-and-sensitivity-considerations" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="limitations-and-sensitivity-considerations">11. Limitations and sensitivity considerations</h4>
<p>The High hazard class is rare (and absent in our test window) so standard accuracy alone can be misleading. We therefore report macro-averaged scores and discuss calibration in the results, but performance on the very rarest conditions remains uncertain. The plausibility cut-offs (e.g., the threshold for snow temperature) are conservative choices, not unique truths; reasonable alternatives could be used, and results may shift slightly.<br>
Finally, because we split by time, outcomes can vary with the split date (e.g., if conditions change from one season to the next). This is typical in operational forecasting; sensitivity checks (e.g., alternate split points or small variations in thresholds and look-back length) would be a natural extension.</p>

<p>This stage uses Python (PyTorch) to learn an ordinal mapping from the feature set prepared in R to the next-day hazard level (FAH). We (i) convert the tabular data into area-wise sequences with a 14-day look-back, (ii) train an LSTM + CORN head (Cumulative Ordinal Regression for Neural networks), (iii) handle imbalance by oversampling and class-balanced per-threshold weights, and (iv) tune monotone decision thresholds for converting CORN probabilities to class labels.</p>
<p>OR:</p>
<p>We model next-day FAH (levels <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>-<span class="math inline">\(4\)</span>) as an ordinal problem in PyTorch (Python). From the R-prepared matrices we build area-wise 14-day look-back sequences and train an LSTM with a CORN head (Cumulative Ordinal Regression for Neural Networks). We address class imbalance via oversampling and class-balanced per-threshold weights, then tune monotone (non-increasing) thresholds to turn CORN probabilities into class labels. Validation is time-aware (forward-chaining folds with a 10-day embargo), and early stopping uses Quadratic Weighted Kappa (QWK).</p>

<p>For sequential learning we constructed area-wise sliding windows with look-back <span class="math inline">\(L = 14\)</span> days and horizon <span class="math inline">\(H = 0\)</span> (predict today�s FAH from the previous 14 days) (Lim and Zohren, 2021; Eq. 2.1). Predictors were split into:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Static features</strong> (fed once per window): longitude, latitude, altitude, incline, and the one-hot area indicators.<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Dynamic features</strong> (fed as a length-<span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> (<span class="math inline">\(14\)</span>) sequence): all remaining numeric predictors after excluding static variables and the target.

<p>The network is an <strong>LSTM</strong> over the dynamic sequence. We take its last hidden state, concatenate it with the static features, pass it through a small MLP head, and then through a CORN layer.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>CORN (Formulation and Rationale):</strong> Instead of a single <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span>-way softmax, CORN produces <span class="math inline">\(K - 1\)</span> logits that answer ordered questions <span class="math inline">\(\Pr(y &gt; 0)\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\Pr(y &gt; 1)\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\ldots\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\Pr(y &gt; K - 2)\)</span>. Because these events become harder as <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> grows, their probabilities naturally decrease with <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> (Cao, Mirjalili and Raschka, 2020).</li>
<li><strong>Training:</strong> We compute CORN targets from the true class and minimise binary cross-entropy on the <span class="math inline">\(K - 1\)</span> logits.</li>
<li><strong>Prediction:</strong> At inference, we threshold the <span class="math inline">\(K - 1\)</span> probabilities, count how many exceed their thresholds, and that count is the predicted FAH level.</li>
<li><strong>Validation metric:</strong> We report <strong>Quadratic Weighted Kappa (QWK)</strong>, which rewards getting close on an ordinal scale (e.g., a <span class="math inline">\(2 \leftrightarrow 3\)</span> mistake is penalised less than <span class="math inline">\(0 \leftrightarrow 4\)</span>).</li>

<ol type="1">

<p>Higher hazard levels are rare, and the distribution also shifts over time. In our split the High level does not occur in the test window, which matters for both training and evaluation. The table below shows the proportion of each FAH level within each split (percents within Train/Test):</p>

<p>The training set shows a relatively balanced distribution across Levels 0-2 (approximately <span class="math inline">\(26\%\)</span>-<span class="math inline">\(31\%\)</span> each), with Level 3 at around <span class="math inline">\(10\%\)</span> and Level 4 at <span class="math inline">\(5\%\)</span> . The test set, however, is heavily skewed: Level 0 dominates ( <span class="math inline">\(\approx 57\%\)</span>), followed by Level 1 (<span class="math inline">\(31\%\)</span> ), Level 2 (<span class="math inline">\(8\%\)</span>), Level 3 (<span class="math inline">\(4\%\)</span>), and Level 4 is virtually absent ( <span class="math inline">\(\sim 0\%\)</span>).</p>
<p>This shift has important implications. A naive model that predicts Level 0 can achieve high Accuracy despite poor overall performance. Macro-F1 and QWK are therefore more informative, as they weight classes evenly and penalise larger ordinal errors. To address the imbalance, the training procedure uses oversampling and a class-balanced CORN loss, while threshold calibration on the final fold helps adapt the decision rule to the test distribution.</p>

<section id="test-performance-model-vs-baselines" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="test-performance-model-vs-baselines">Test Performance (Model vs Baselines)</h3>
<p>Below we compare the tuned LSTM-CORN model with three simple baselines. We evaluate performance using four metrics: <strong>Accuracy</strong>, <strong>Macro-F1</strong>, <strong>Mean Absolute Error (MAE)</strong>, and <strong>Quadratic Weighted Kappa (QWK)</strong>. Accuracy measures the proportion of exact predictions but can be misleading under class imbalance (e.g., always predicting the majority class). Macro-F1 computes precision and recall per class, takes their harmonic mean, and averages equally across classes. This handles imbalance better but ignores class ordering. MAE uses the ordinal scale directly, averaging absolute differences between true and predicted levels (e.g., a miss of <span class="math inline">\(0 \to 1\)</span> counts as 1, while <span class="math inline">\(0 \to 4\)</span> counts as 4), with a range from <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(K - 1\)</span>. QWK is a chance-corrected agreement measure that penalises larger ordinal gaps using quadratic weights. It ranges from 1 (perfect) to 0 (chance) and can be less than 0 (worse than chance), making it well suited to ordinal targets and useful for validation.</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="cell-output cell-output-stdout">

</div>
</div>
<p>On the held-out test window, the persistence rule (predict today as yesterday within area) is the strongest comparator: QWK <span class="math inline">\(\approx 0.659\)</span>, Accuracy <span class="math inline">\(\approx 0.719\)</span>, MAE <span class="math inline">\(\approx 0.329\)</span>, Macro-F1 <span class="math inline">\(\approx 0.456\)</span> The tuned LSTM-CORN improves markedly over the two majority heuristics but does not reach persistence, with QWK <span class="math inline">\(\approx 0.390\)</span>, Accuracy <span class="math inline">\(\approx 0.648\)</span>, MAE <span class="math inline">\(\approx 0.433\)</span>, and Macro-F1 <span class="math inline">\(\approx 0.295\)</span>.<br>
</p>
<p>The majority baselines are near chance in ordinal agreement (global QWK <span class="math inline">\(\approx 0\)</span>; per-area QWK <span class="math inline">\(\approx 0.09\)</span>), confirming that always picking the common class is not competitive.</p>
<p>To read these numbers: <strong>QWK</strong> (Quadratic Weighted Kappa) is our most appropriate headline metric because it respects ordering, penalising large misses more than adjacent ones (higher is better). <strong>MAE</strong> reports the average absolute distance between forecast and truth on the 0-4 scale (lower is better). <strong>Accuracy</strong> is exact-match rate and can look flattering under imbalance, while <strong>Macro-F1</strong> balances precision and recall across classes by giving each class equal weight.</p>
<p>The pattern suggests the test period is highly persistent and skewed toward lower hazard-there are no “High” days-so copying yesterday is often correct and unusually hard to beat. Although the neural model learns meaningful ordinal structure (clear gains over majority rules), it trails persistence on this particular window, likely due to strong day-to-day autocorrelation and a distribution shift between train and test.</p>
<p>Class-wise performance is therefore uneven, with under-prediction at the upper levels and most errors occurring between adjacent categories-which QWK appropriately down-weights. In practice, persistence remains the operational benchmark in stable regimes, while the LSTM-CORN is most promising for anticipating changes in hazard; we examine this further via the confusion matrix and per-class summaries.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="confusion-matrix-and-per-class-report">Confusion Matrix and Per-Class Report</h3>
<p>The matrix shows a clear <strong>ordinal pattern</strong>. Class 0 is predicted well (about <span class="math inline">\(0.90\)</span> on the diagonal), with a small spill into class 1. For class 1, only <span class="math inline">\(\sim 0.39\)</span> stays on the diagonal, and <span class="math inline">\(\sim 0.58\)</span> is pushed down to 0; the model tends to <strong>under-forecast</strong> when conditions are near the 0/1 boundary. Class 2 is mostly confused with undefined (<span class="math inline">\(\approx 0.47\)</span>) and sometimes with 0 (<span class="math inline">\(\approx 0.37\)</span>); only <span class="math inline">\(\sim 0.16\)</span> is correct. Class 3 is rarely predicted directly (<span class="math inline">\(\sim 0.15\)</span> diagonal) and is most often mapped to 1 (<span class="math inline">\(\approx 0.52\)</span>) or 0 (<span class="math inline">\(\approx 0.31\)</span>). There is effectively no reliable signal for class 4 in the test window (support is 1 and it is predicted as a 1), so per-class scores for 4 are unstable and shouldn�t be over-interpreted.</p>
<p>This pattern matches the aggregate metrics reported earlier: overall accuracy and MAE are reasonable, but Macro-F1 and QWK suffer because the model compresses higher hazards toward the centre/lower classes. In other words, most errors are one-step, downward mistakes, good for avoiding extreme over-calls but conservative relative to true highs.</p>
<p>If the operational goal is to catch more 2-3 days (accepting some extra false alarms), you could lower the upper CORN thresholds slightly or use a cost-sensitive tuning target. If the priority is minimising over-warnings, the current calibration is aligned with that objective.</p>

<p>We re-evaluated the test set twice: once using the tuned monotone thresholds <span class="math inline">\(\tau = [0.52, 0.50, 0.50, 0.48]\)</span><br>
and once using flat <span class="math inline">\(0.5\)</span> cut-offs for all CORN logits. The two runs produced <strong>identical</strong> results:<br>
Accuracy <span class="math inline">\(= 0.648\)</span>, Macro-F1 <span class="math inline">\(= 0.295\)</span>, MAE <span class="math inline">\(= 0.433\)</span>, QWK <span class="math inline">\(= 0.390\)</span>.</p>
<p>This tells us that, on this test window, threshold calibration <strong>did not change any predicted labels</strong>.<br>
That is consistent with two facts: (i) the tuned <span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span> are very close to <span class="math inline">\(0.5\)</span>, and (ii) most cumulative probabilities were far from the decision boundaries, so nudging thresholds within <span class="math inline">\(0.48\)</span>-<span class="math inline">\(0.52\)</span> doesn�t flip classes.</p>
<p>This implies the model�s test performance is driven by the sequence model and learned representations, rather than by the post-hoc thresholds. We keep the tuned <span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span> for completeness and because they can help when class balance shifts, but we do <strong>not</strong> claim a test-set gain from calibration here. If thresholding becomes more influential (e.g., under stronger distribution shift), broader grids, direct QWK optimisation, or area-specific <span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span> could be explored.</p>

<p>The figure above shows the distribution of absolute errors <span class="math inline">\(|y_{\text{true}} - y_{\text{pred}}|\)</span> across FAH levels.<br>
The model achieves an exact match on about 65% of test days (error <span class="math inline">\(= 0\)</span>), and a further <span class="math inline">\(\sim 28\)</span>-<span class="math inline">\(29\%\)</span> are off by one category. Only <span class="math inline">\(\sim 6\%\)</span> are off by two and <span class="math inline">\(&lt;1\%\)</span> by three; no four-step errors occur.</p>
<p>This aligns with the summary statistics (MAE <span class="math inline">\(\approx 0.43\)</span>, median absolute error <span class="math inline">\(\approx 0\)</span>):<br>
in an ordinal setting, most misclassifications are near misses. Operationally, this means the model is usually within one hazard step of the issued level, even when it is wrong.</p>

<section id="discussion" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="discussion">Discussion</h2>
<p>The held-out results paint a clear picture. Hazards in this period are highly persistent and skewed toward the lower levels, and the naive persistence rule (“predict today as yesterday within area”) performs very strongly on all summary metrics. Our tuned LSTM-CORN improves markedly over the two majority baselines, but it does not beat persistence on this particular test window.</p>
<section id="metrics-diagnostics" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="metrics-diagnostics">Metrics &amp; Diagnostics</h3>
<p>Accuracy and MAE are reasonable for the neural model, but the QWK and macro-F1 show performance drops higher up the scale. This is consistent with the near-diagonal confusion matrix that has a downward bias (Level 1 is often pushed to 0; Levels 2-3 are frequently mapped to 1) while extreme over-calls are rare. The error histogram shows most misses are within one category (consistent with MAE <span class="math inline">\(\approx 0.43\)</span>): useful for avoiding false alarms, but conservative relative to true highs. Finally, threshold calibration had almost no effect (tuned <span class="math inline">\(\tau \approx [0.52, 0.50, 0.50, 0.48]\)</span> and gave identical results to 0.5), which implies the limiting factor is representation/sequence learning, not the label cut-offs.</p>
</section>
<section id="why-persistence-wins-here" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-persistence-wins-here">Why persistence wins here</h3>
<p>Two data realities favour the <span class="math inline">\(y[t-1]\)</span> rule:<br>
(i) <strong>strong day-to-day autocorrelation</strong> in FAH;<br>
(ii) <strong>imbalance and shift:</strong> the test window contains no “High” days and is dominated by Levels 0-1. In that regime, copying yesterday is genuinely hard to beat. The LSTM-CORN learns the ordinal structure and avoids wild swings, but with few upper-level examples and a short 14-day context, it struggles to escalate to 2-3 when the series does move.</p>
</section>
<section id="operational-interpretation" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="operational-interpretation">Operational interpretation</h3>
<p>If the near-term goal is to minimise false alarms, the current calibration is acceptable: errors are mostly one-step and downward. If instead the priority is to catch emerging higher hazards, you would tolerate more false positives and lower the effective thresholds for the top levels (a cost-sensitive calibration). Either way, persistence remains a strong benchmark, and the neural-persistence disagreements are useful review flags.</p>
</section>
<section id="limitations" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="limitations">Limitations</h3>
<p>Conclusions are conditioned on this split: the test window lacks class 4 entirely and has very few class 3 days, so per-class scores at the top end are unstable. The dataset is modest for sequence models, labels may contain operational noise, and we restricted the model to observed histories (no external forecasts), which caps lead-time sensitivity. We mitigated leakage with forward-chaining folds and an embargo, but results will vary with split point and winter severity.</p>
</section>
<section id="possible-future-improvements" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="possible-future-improvements">Possible Future Improvements</h3>
<p>Short-to-medium steps that fit the current pipeline:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Longer and/or multi-scale context</strong> (e.g., 28-45 days plus recent 7-day summary features) to help detect trend changes.<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Area- or season-specific calibration</strong> of <span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span>, or a simple <strong>cost-sensitive threshold</strong> that weights upward errors more heavily.<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Richer dynamics</strong>: include forecasted weather (when available) and simple change features (day-to-day deltas, 7-day slopes).<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Ordinal-aware loss variants</strong> (e.g., ordinal focal/Tversky) to emphasise rare upward moves without exploding false alarms.<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Modeling with persistence</strong> rather than against it: feed <span class="math inline">\(y[t-1]\)</span> explicitly (we already include it) and/or ensemble the neural model with the persistence rule; use the ensemble to trigger escalation only when both agree.</li>
</ul>
<p>For this winter slice, FAH rewards yesterday-equals-today. The LSTM-CORN gives mostly one-step, conservative predictions and clearly outperforms majority rules, but not persistence. With more imbalance-aware training, longer context, and cost-sensitive calibration or ensembling, it should provide earlier and more reliable hazard signals while retaining low false-alarm rates.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="conclusion" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>This work developed a reproducible pipeline for ordinal avalanche forecasting, combining structured data preparation, time-aware validation, and an LSTM-CORN model adjusted for class imbalance and monotone decision thresholds. On the held-out test window, the neural model outperforms both majority baselines but does not surpass persistence. This is expected given the strong day-to-day autocorrelation and the concentration of FAH at lower levels during this period.</p>
<p>The diagnostics are consistent with this outcome. The confusion matrix is near-diagonal with a slight downward bias, MAE (<span class="math inline">\(\approx 0.43\)</span>) indicates that most errors fall within one category, and threshold calibration has negligible effect. This suggests that the main limitations lie in the data regime and sequence representation rather than in the choice of decision cut-offs.</p>
<p>From an operational perspective, the model is conservative and unlikely to produce extreme over-warnings. Its greatest value is in cases where it diverges from persistence, indicating potential changes in hazard. Sensitivity to rising risk could be improved through longer or multi-scale look-back periods, cost-sensitive or area- and season-specific calibration, the inclusion of forecasted weather and change features, and the use of ordinal focal or Tversky losses, or ensembling with persistence.</p>
<p>Additional “High” days and further winters will help stabilise estimates at the upper levels. Overall, the method is interpretable and extensible. With targeted refinements, it has the potential to provide earlier and more reliable indicators of increasing avalanche hazard while maintaining a low false alarm rate.</p>

<p>At the start, we shared the assignment brief and asked for a sensible three-way split to manage scope and timelines (data preparation, modelling, and report integration). The initial split helped us coordinate responsibilities, and we adapted it to our context. See the following link: (https://chatgpt.com/share/68d91860-f4a4-8006-ae9c-06e71721af0a).</p>

<p>We used AI to make code presentable and navigable inside the report so a reader can follow the narrative and the code together:</p>
<ul>
<li>Refactored and streamlined/condensed code blocks (docstrings, clearer names, comments) without changing logic.<br>
</li>
<li>Added Quarto-friendly chunks (labels, captions, seeds) so outputs render reproducibly in PDF, this was especially utilised for Python chunks.<br>
</li>
<li>Wrote small utilities for CORN threshold tuning, evaluation, and plotting (confusion-matrix heatmap, metric tables), and debugged minor issues.<br>
</li>
<li>Double-checked that the time split and folds prevented leakage, and that train/test separation was respected in every data path.</li>

<p>Any AI-suggested code was run directly by us, and retained only if it was correct, readable, and consistent with our pipeline.</p>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="writing-supplementary-assistance---we-retained-authorial-control">4) Writing (supplementary assistance - we retained authorial control)</h4>
<p>We used AI as an editor and explainer, not as an author. It helped with coverage checks, clarity, and presentation. We kept control of the structure, final wording, and all technical claims.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Coverage audit of Methods vs code:</strong> We asked AI to cross-check that everything happening in the code is actually described in the text (e.g., sequence construction, forward-chaining folds with an embargo, CORN targets and loss, threshold tuning, baselines). It flagged a few gaps and we filled them. Anything inaccurate was discarded.<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Plain-language tightening:</strong> It suggested alternative phrasings for the LSTM/CORN/QWK explanations and helped trim repetition so sections read cleanly without losing technical meaning.<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Flow and structure:</strong> It helped reorder sentences and add short signposts so paragraphs read as a narrative rather than a list of steps. However, overall narrative flow in the report is above the current abilities of AI (or at least for it to be done well and efficiently), so this was done independently.</li>
<li><strong>Captions and presentation:</strong> It drafted first-pass figure/table captions, and we then aligned labels, units, and legends (e.g., rows=true/cols=pred in the confusion matrix, and helped provide metric definitions for us to include under the comparison table).<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Consistency sweep:</strong> We used it to spot inconsistencies in symbols and names (e.g., <code>FAH_ord</code>, <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span>), units (<span class="math inline">\(^\circ C\)</span>, cm, m/s), and split terminology (“train/test”, “validation fold”), and then standardised them across the report.<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Word-count management:</strong> It helped us condense our abstract, introduction, and conclusion into more concise versions. We only kept edits that preserved our meaning and emphasis.<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Micro-explanations for readers:</strong> Where code terms might block understanding (e.g., “oversampling”, “class-balanced loss”), it helped draft one-line, non-jargony explanations that we then rewrote in our own words and integrated within our written report.</li>
</ul>
<p>As a way of keeping authorship and accuracy, we wrote the first drafts ourselves. AI suggestions were used as options, not final text. We rewrote text in our voice, verified technical statements against the code and outputs, and removed anything we did not understand. All numbers, metrics, thresholds, and plots were produced and checked by us.</p>

All preprocessing parameters were fit by us on the training set and applied to test via a baked pipeline; seeds and caches were used for reproducibility.</p>

<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Planning:</strong> “Given this brief, propose a practical 3-way task split and a checklist of outputs/figures we�ll need. Keep it realistic for a short timeline.”<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Method design:</strong> “In 3 to 4 sentences, justify forward-chaining validation with an embargo for next-day avalanche hazard. Operationally, not mathematically.”<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Learning the ordinal head (CORN):</strong> “I�m reading the Shi, Cao, and Raschka paper and not fully grasping it. Why use <span class="math inline">\(K - 1\)</span> logits for <span class="math inline">\(P(y &gt; k)\)</span>? How are targets built directly from labels, and how do monotone thresholds turn those probabilities into one class? Please explain in plain English with a tiny <span class="math inline">\(K = 5\)</span> example and common pitfalls so I can understand this theory better.”</li>
<li><strong>Imbalance rationale:</strong> “In a couple of sentences, explain why we oversample in batches and use class-balanced weights (<span class="math inline">\(\beta = 0.999\)</span>) for CORN. Emphasise rare exceedances without inventing data.”<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Results narrative:</strong> “Turn this metrics table (Accuracy, Macro-F1, MAE, QWK) into a brief, neutral comparison vs baselines. Additionally, explain what each metric means in one line so that I can try include a brief definitions when I introduce them”</li>
<li><strong>Figure polish (Quarto/PDF):</strong> “Give a captioned confusion-matrix heatmap (rows=true, cols=pred) with a readable palette and percent labels. Make it knitr/Quarto-ready.”<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Quarto snippets:</strong> “Produce labelled, captioned chunks for a confusion-matrix figure and a formatted metrics table suitable for PDF export.”<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Abstract tightening:</strong> “Cut this abstract to around 150 words. Keep aims (LSTM+CORN), time-aware validation, key metrics, and one-line takeaway.”</li>
</ol>
<p>In each case, we reviewed/edited the draft and ran the code to confirm it worked with our data.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="limits-of-the-ais-role">Limits of the AI�s role</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>No autonomous analysis:</strong> AI did not choose the final methodology, set hyperparameters, or produce final results. Those came from our group�s design, runs, and checks.<br>
</li>
<li><strong>No blind copying:</strong> We avoided pasting large blocks of AI generated text or code. Anything kept was edited and verified by us.<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Potential inaccuracies:</strong> LLMs can be wrong or overconfident. We treated explanations as suggestions, then validated against code and papers.<br>
</li>
<li><strong>No access to private data or execution:</strong> AI did not run our experiments or access hidden datasets. We executed everything locally and controlled random seeds/caches.<br>

<section id="benefits" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="benefits">Benefits</h2>
<p>Using an LLM mainly helped with structure, clarity, and polish while we kept control of the ideas, code, and results.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Editorial shaping:</strong> It can take a rough draft and provide insights into how to make it more concise and appropriate for a scientific report, by suggesting tightening sentences. This allows us to still keep our tone and intent intact.<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Clarity through compression:</strong> It reduces repetition and surfaces the main argument, which helped us get to the core of what we were trying to say (especially in terms of structuring a Methods Section and when trying to integrate a short literature review inside the Introduction).<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Decomposing chaotic sections:</strong> When a section felt messy, offered points on how to reorganised it into digestible pieces (clear paragraphs, headings, short lists) so readers can follow the logic.<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Audience-fit translation:</strong> It can help turn code-heavy or jargony passages into plain-English explanations that are self-contained, so the report stands on its own without the reader opening the code.<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Code ideation &amp; efficiency:</strong> Once we were clear on intent, it proposed cleaner patterns (small utilities, vectorised operations, reusable plotting functions). We only kept changes that we verified improved readability or runtime without altering results.<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Formatting and presentation:</strong> It sped up figure/table styling for PDF (captions, labels, palettes, legends) and Quarto chunk hygiene (seeds, paths, cache). This helps save us time we could spend on analysis.<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Consistency checks:</strong> It was useful for quick passes on naming, units, date boundaries, and split logic, reducing accidental inconsistencies across sections.<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Focused learning support:</strong> For more complex sections (e.g., CORN thresholds, QWK) it provided explanations and examples for us to better understand the theory.<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Cognitive offloading:</strong> It generated checklists, micro-templates, and alternative phrasings on demand, which helped us move faster without skipping the verification steps.</li>
<li><strong>Sanity checks:</strong> It was useful for quick checks on validation design (forward-chaining + embargo), metric definitions, and common pitfalls. This saved us time while we kept control of decisions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, the LLM worked like a sharp editor and sounding board: it helped us restructure, clarify, and polish, while we did the design, execution, and final judgement calls.</p>
